# How to
To create a crew that accomplishes the steps you've outlined, we will set up multiple agents, each with a specific role:

1. **API Reader Agent:** Reads information from a REST API that returns a collection.
2. **Element Processor Agent:** For each element in the collection, reads additional information from another REST API.
3. **Data Reducer Agent:** Summarizes the collected data.
4. **Visualizer Agent:** Creates a bar chart from the summarized data.
## Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Define Agents:** We will create four agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.
2. **Create Tasks:** Each task corresponds to a step in your process.
3. **Configure the Crew:** Set up the crew to handle the process flow.
4. **Kickoff the Process:** Use the crew.kickoff method to start the workflow.

Let's start by setting up the code for the crew.

### 1. Setting Up Agents
We will create the following agents:

API Reader Agent: Uses a tool to make the first API call and fetches the collection.
Element Processor Agent: Iterates over the collection, making another API call for each element.
Data Reducer Agent: Analyzes the gathered data to produce a summary.
Visualizer Agent: Takes the summary and creates a bar chart.
### 2. Creating Tools
We'll define custom tools to handle API calls and data visualization.

Code Example
```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import Tool

# Set up your environment variables for any APIs used
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["API_ENDPOINT_1"] = "https://api.firstendpoint.com/data"
os.environ["API_ENDPOINT_2"] = "https://api.secondendpoint.com/data"

# Tool to perform the first API call to fetch the collection
class FirstAPIFetchTool(Tool):
    def use(self) -> str:
        import requests
        response = requests.get(os.environ["API_ENDPOINT_1"])
        return response.json()

# Tool to perform the second API call for each element in the collection
class SecondAPIFetchTool(Tool):
    def use(self, element_id: str) -> str:
        import requests
        url = f"{os.environ['API_ENDPOINT_2']}/{element_id}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.json()

# Tool to create a bar chart from summarized data
class BarChartTool(Tool):
    def use(self, summary: dict) -> str:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Creating a bar chart
        plt.bar(summary.keys(), summary.values())
        plt.xlabel('Category')
        plt.ylabel('Value')
        plt.title('Summary Bar Chart')
        plt.savefig('summary_bar_chart.png')

        return "Bar chart created and saved as summary_bar_chart.png."

# Agent to fetch the initial collection from API 1
api_reader_agent = Agent(
    role='API Reader',
    goal='Fetch a collection from the first REST API',
    tools=[FirstAPIFetchTool()],
    backstory='You are adept at reading data from APIs quickly and efficiently.'
)

# Agent to process each element of the collection using API 2
element_processor_agent = Agent(
    role='Element Processor',
    goal='For each item in the collection, retrieve detailed information from the second API.',
    tools=[SecondAPIFetchTool()],
    backstory='You specialize in iterating over data and extracting detailed information efficiently.'
)

# Agent to summarize data
data_reducer_agent = Agent(
    role='Data Reducer',
    goal='Analyze and summarize the data collected from the APIs.',
    backstory='You excel at data analysis and reducing complex datasets to meaningful summaries.'
)

# Agent to create a bar chart visualization
visualizer_agent = Agent(
    role='Visualizer',
    goal='Create a bar chart to visualize the summarized data.',
    tools=[BarChartTool()],
    backstory='You have a knack for turning data into easy-to-understand visual formats.'
)

# Task to read data from the first API
task1 = Task(
    description="Read a collection from the first REST API.",
    expected_output="A collection of items retrieved from the first API.",
    tools=[FirstAPIFetchTool()],
    agent=api_reader_agent
)

# Task to read data from the second API for each element in the collection
task2 = Task(
    description="For each element in the collection, read detailed information from the second REST API.",
    expected_output="A list of detailed data for each element in the collection.",
    tools=[SecondAPIFetchTool()],
    agent=element_processor_agent
)

# Task to summarize the collected data
task3 = Task(
    description="Summarize the detailed data from the second API into a meaningful format.",
    expected_output="A summary of the data collected from the APIs.",
    agent=data_reducer_agent
)

# Task to create a bar chart from the summary
task4 = Task(
    description="Create a bar chart visualization from the summarized data.",
    expected_output="A bar chart that visualizes the summarized data.",
    tools=[BarChartTool()],
    agent=visualizer_agent
)

# Define the crew and process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[api_reader_agent, element_processor_agent, data_reducer_agent, visualizer_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3, task4],
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Kickoff the process
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```
### Explanation
- **API Reader Agent:** Uses FirstAPIFetchTool to fetch the initial data.
- **Element Processor Agent:** Iterates over the fetched collection, using SecondAPIFetchTool.
- **Data Reducer Agent:** Summarizes the collected data.
- **Visualizer Agent:** Uses BarChartTool to create and save a bar chart.
### Next Steps
Replace "Your Key" with your actual API keys.
Adjust the API endpoints and payloads according to your specific needs.
Run the script to execute the crew workflow.
